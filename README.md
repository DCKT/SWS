Am I the only one who is lazy to install Apache just for testing some HTML or JavaScript code (like XHR) ?


## Setup
`npm install -g localhost-now`

You can now launch anywhere on your computer a small web server by running `localhost` in your terminal.


By default, the web server will run on **localhost:1337**. You can set a custom port by specify the port when you
launch the server : `localhost 8080` for example.
